# crongo
Simple GO cron system

## Purpose

The goal of this project is offer an alternative to the Heroku scheduler addon for GO apps.  

I hope to implement a few improvements over Heroku scheduler or other GO alternatives but
this will largely be a learning experience with some of GO's concurrency features.

## Usage 

TODO: The project is still in development and the interface is not considered stable at the moment
